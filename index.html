            <p>
              Active learning contexts can speed knowledge acquisition by allowing people to select highly informative examples based on their prior experience. But real-world learning often involves both active and passive training, an interaction that we know little about. Moreover, work in machine learning shows that active learning systems can perform worse than random sampling when starting with the wrong initial hypothesis. In three large-scale experiments with adults, we replicate the active learning advantage found in previous work (Experiment 1). Then we build on these findings to test the effects of different sequences of active/passive training (Experiment 2) on the effectiveness of active learning. Finally, we test how the learner's initial hypohtesis influences the quality of their active exploration (Experiment 3). Across all experiments, active training resulted in better learning of the target category boundary. Accuracy was better when people received passive training before active training. And active learning was hindered when there was mismatch between the learner's prior hypotheses and the target category structure. The overall pattern of results did not change for a more complex category structure. Our replication provides additional support that active learning confers an advantage over passive learning. Our extension results show that active learning is more effective when the learner already has some experience with the task and when they were given the correct initial hypothesis.
