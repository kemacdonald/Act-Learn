                  "loop antennas" for televisions and each antenna 
                  receives one of two channels (CH1 or CH2). 

                  <br><br>

                  The channel received by an antenna depends on <b>a SINGLE feature, either the antenna's SIZE OR ANGLE</b>.

                    <br><br>

                    The antennas are noisy and 
                    can pick up the wrong channel on occasion, so you 
                    should learn what channel is most often received 
                    by a particular type of antenna.

                    In this game, you will be able to design and test your own antennas.

                    *To adjust the size, press and release the <b>Z key</b>, 
                    then click/drag the antenna <b>L/R</b>. <br> 
                    *To adjust the angle, press and release the <b>X key</b>, 
                    then click/drag the antenna <b>L/R</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>NOTE: you will have to click inside the antenna to adjust it. </b>

                    <br><br>
                    Also, you will design many antennas, so you do not need to spend too much
                    time on each one. Once you are satisfied with your antenna, 
                    <b>press C</b> to learn what station it receives.

                    <br><br>

                    Remember, your goal is to learn the difference between the two types of antennas, 
                    so you can predict which channel a new antenna will recieve. 

                    <br><br>

                    First, you will do two practice trials to learn how to design your own antennas. <br>
