My accuracy went down from 96% to 93%; I think because I made riskier assessments the second time; to me, it seemed the angle was useless, and size mattered most (first round through seems to support this.)  If that's the case, then a grid would have helped.  I didn't see any correlation between angle at all, though I reckon I could have kept one size and played with that aspect.
